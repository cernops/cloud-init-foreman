This directory contains resources for building and deploying foreman module for
cloud-init. The module should be installed together with amiconfig on a virtual
disk image. An instance run from the image then registers itself to foreman
database into a hostgroup. The parameters are passed to the module from 
the #cloud-config hashtag.

Following are parameters defined for the user data:

Mandatory parameters:
    master - a puppet master where the instance should be registered
    hostgroup - hostgroup for an instance
    login - login for foreman RESTFUL API
    password - password for foreman RESTFUL API

Example of cloud-init userdata (YAML in case of $cloud-config) is then:
#cloud-config
foreman:
  server: "https://punch.cern.ch"
  hostgroup: "base/lxbatch"
  login: "test_admin"
  password: "hatepuppies"

    

Optional parameters: architecture, model, operatingsystem, environment, domain,
ptable

The optional parameters are by default autodetected or set to fixed value.

In order to create rpm, you need proper directory structure in your home directory:

~/rpmbuild/
    |-- BUILD/
    |-- RPMS/
    |-- SOURCES/
    |-- SPECS/
    `-- SRPMS/

then do 
# make rpm

in the project directory and you will have rpm in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch
